\section{Introduction}\label{sec:omics-intro}
Numerous transcriptional changes have been implicated in the development of acquired drug-resistance in MM.
It is also pertinent to ascertain if the changes seen in the transcriptome are reflected in protein expression.
Therefore both transcriptional changes and proteomic changes must be studied.

The changes between PI-sensitive (WT) AMO-1 cells and PI-resistant (aCFZ/aBTZ) AMO-1 cells will be looked at.
In addition, the BRPF1B/TRIM24 dual inhibitor (TRIM24i) was shown in the previous chapter to effectively kill carfilzomib resistant AMO-1 cells in the presence of carfilzomib (but not without carfilzomib), whilst not affecting WT AMO-1 cells.
Thus suggesting TRIM24i has a mechanism of action that is capable of reversing aCFZ cells' resistance, and re-sensitising them to carfilzomib again.
aCFZ cells treated with TRIM24i will be compared to control aCFZ cells, to better understand the mechanism of action of TRIM24i.
Furthermore, these changes must be compared to the differences seen between WT and aCFZ cells.
Considering TRIM24i seems to make aCFZ cells sensitive to carfilzomib again, it may be the case that it is reversing some of the changes seen between WT and aCFZ cells.

\section{Results}\label{sec:omics-results}

\subsection{Transcriptional changes}\label{sec:omics-transcriptomics}
To investigate the transcriptional changes that underlie the development of acquired-PI-resistance in multiple myeloma a number of RNA-seq experiments to compare WT, carfilzomib resistant (aCFZ) and bortezomib (aBTZ) AMO-1 cells were performed, both at the bulk and single-cell level.

Principle component analysis (PCA) showed differential clustering of the different cell lines...
[PCA of different cell lines, WT, aCFZ, aBTZ]


xyz differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between WT and aCFZ cells.

\subsubsection{TRIM24i reversal}
To investigate how TRIM24i reverses the resistance phenotype in aCFZ cells, bulk RNA-seq was employed.
aCFZ cells (100\si{\nano\Molar} carfilzomib) were treated with DMSO or 10\si{\mu\Molar} TRIM24i (in triplicate).
The results from this experiment were compared against the results from the previous bulk-RNA experiment of WT controls vs aCFZ cells (100\si{\nano\Molar} carfilzomib).

As seen in figure \ref{fig:bulk_fig1_de_clustering}, PCA and sample-sample clustering shows TRIM24i treated aCFZ cells clustering away from aCFZ controls.
The sample-sample clustering shows TRIM24i treated aCFZ cells clustering closer to WT cells than the aCFZ controls are, suggesting the TRIM24i treatment has made them more similar to WT cells, agreeing with our hypothesis following the dose-response curve results.

Next, transcription factors (TFs) were explored.
Figure \ref{fig:bulk_tf_heatmap} shows a heatmap for DE ($p \leq 0.01$) transcription factors between aCFZ controls and TRIM24i treated aCFZ cells.
Figure \ref{fig:bulk_tf_venn} shows a venn diagram for differentially expressed ($p \leq 0.01$) TFs.
Transcription factors whose expression have been `reversed' by TRIM24i treatment (i.e. TFs that are up-regulated in aCFZ cells compared to WT, and down-regulated in TRIM24i treated aCFZ cells compared to aCFZ controls, and vice versa) are highlighted in the intersection of the venn diagrams.


\subsection{Phosphoproteomics}\label{subsec:omics-phospho}
Phosphoproteomics was performed (method outlined in section \ref{sec:methods-phospho}).
Five conditions were investigated: WT, aCFZ (+100\si{\nano\Molar} carfilzomib), aCFZ treated with TRIM24 inhibitor (+100\si{\nano\Molar} carfilzomib), aCFZ treated with TRIM24 inhibitor (no carfilzomib), and WT treated with TRIM24 inhibitor.
