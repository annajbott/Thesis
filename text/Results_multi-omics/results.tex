\section{Introduction}\label{sec:omics-intro}
Numerous transcriptional changes have been implicated in the development of acquired drug-resistance in MM.
It is also pertinent to ascertain if the changes seen in the transcriptome are reflected in protein expression.

\section{Results}\label{sec:omics-results}

\subsection{Transcriptional changes}\label{sec:omics-transcriptomics}
To investigate the transcriptional changes that underlie the development of acquired-PI-resistance in multiple myeloma a number of RNA-seq experiments to compare WT, carfilzomib resistant (aCFZ) and bortezomib (aBTZ) AMO-1 cells were performed, both at the bulk and single-cell level.

Principle component analysis (PCA) showed differential clustering of the different cell lines...
[PCA of different cell lines, WT, aCFZ, aBTZ]




xyz differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified between WT and aCFZ cells.


\subsection{Phosphoproteomics}\label{subsec:omics-phospho}
Phosphoproteomics was performed (method outlined in section \ref{sec:methods-phospho}).
Five conditions were investigated: WT, aCFZ (+100\si{\nano\Molar} carfilzomib), aCFZ treated with TRIM24 inhibitor (+100\si{\nano\Molar} carfilzomib), aCFZ treated with TRIM24 inhibitor (no carfilzomib), and WT treated with TRIM24 inhibitor.
