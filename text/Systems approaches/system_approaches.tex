% WT BTZ CFZ
To investigate the transcriptional changes that underlie the acquired-PI-resistance in MM a number of RNA-seq experiments to comparing WT, carfilzomib resistant (aCFZ) and bortezomib (aBTZ) AMO-1 cells were performed, both at the bulk and single-cell level.
Bulk RNA-seq has been performed for both batch 1 resistant AMO-1 cells (generated by the Driessen lab) and in-house batch 2 AMO-1 cells.

\subsubsection{Batch 1 AMO-1 cells bulk RNA-seq}
Bulk RNA-seq was performed for WT, aBTZ and aCFZ batch 1 AMO-1 cells.
WT cells were treated with
xyz genes were differentially expressed (DE; $p-adj\leq0.05$ and LogFC $\geq1$) between WT and aCFZ, xzy genes were DE between WT and aBTZ\@.
zyx genes were DE between aBTZ and aCFZ\@.
