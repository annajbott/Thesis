%I would like to thank my supervisors Dr Adam Cribbs, Professor Udo Oppermann and Dr Sarah Gooding for all of their support and guidance throughout my DPhil. I would also like to thank Dr James Dunford, Dr Martin Philpott and Dr Filiz Sengabobulo, Dr Chao Mike Jiang and Dr Henry Lee for all of their help and knowledge in the wet lab and general banter in the office. Huge thanks to Professor Kessler's lab including Dr Darragh O'Brien and Dr Adan De Pinto for allowing me to work with them at the TDI and their proteomics expertise.
%I would also like to acknowledge my family for putting up with me during my PhD and letting me live rent free at home for four years- thanks Pam and Mike for being living in Oxford, very convenient!! Also thank you again to mum and sister for proof reading everything I've ever written, even if the science makes zero sense to you!
